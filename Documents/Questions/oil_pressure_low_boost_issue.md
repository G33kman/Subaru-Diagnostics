Hey everyone, first off, I'm sorry for the long post, it has been a long year...

I have been working on this car since last August and after replacing the motor (spun bearing) with a different short block and heads, I have been working through a few issues to get the car to a point where I can drive it daily.

**AFTERMARKET PARTS** (These all came with the car)
* APC or whatever is similar (can't see the letters clearly) TMIC
* Grimmspeed AOS (heard these aren't the greatest)
* Cobb BPV
* COBB Accessport v3
* Invidia (Cat-less) Turbo-back exhaust (dual)
* Recently pulled the entire dash out to fix the clutch pedal bracket on the firewall. The clutch pedal doesn't twist anymore.

When the motor was replaced, I took the heads and short block to the machine shop and had them checked out and the heads planed, I ordered a new timing belt kit, water pump, oil pump, spark plugs, head gaskets, and head bolts. As well as anything else that was needed when re-building a motor (I can't remember off-hand).
I did look over the oil pan and didn't see anything when the motor was being put back together.
I also, looked at the turbo and there wasn't any shaft play or anything that seemed to say the turbo was bad (from what I researched) before being put in the motor.
At first the car drove great, but I was getting some CEL's:
* P0128 - Engine Coolant Below Operating Temperature. Replaced coolant and coolant temp sensor. FIXED
* P2419 - EVAP System. Disappeared after replacing coolant temp sensor. FIXED?

I am down to 2 issues and I'm not sure if they are related so I am going to list them both just in case.

**Issue 1** [NO CEL]: I am unable to boost past between 4 and 6 psi (feels like it stumbles or falls on its face) getting on the highway is a real blast...
Things I have tried:
* Created a "DIY" compressed air test (10 psi max), did find a couple of vacuum leaks and fixed them but didn't really notice a difference. Used soapy water to check for leaks.
* Verified that the restrictor pills, yes there are 2 (one on each side of the t-connector) one on the wastegate side and another on the compressor side. Smaller pill going to the wastegate.
* Wastegate will open and close smoothly when compressed air is applied

**Issue 2** [P0011] and [P0022}: When the car warms up, I start getting the oil pressure light when I come to a stop, at first the rpms will dip low and then the vehicle will die at a stop every time. P0022 went away after replacing the AVCS Solenoids but P0011 still comes up.
Things I have tried:
* Pressurizing the system (foot on clutch and gas pedal when starting (cranking) the motor. It does shut the oil light off after about 5 seconds
* Replaced the AVCS Intake Solenoids on both sides
* Replaced the oil and filter
* Replaced the oil pressure sensor (in the front of the motor by the coolant temp sensor)
* Checked the banjo bolts (no screens anywhere to be seen

I have checked the oil level, and it seems to be staying consistent, but I haven't driven it very much for fear of blowing the "new" motor up.
I am currently not getting any other CEL's than the P0011 code.

My DAM, Knock Sensor, and Fine Knock Learn are sitting where they should be (mostly), the DAM is sitting at 1.00 other than if the ECU is reset then it will start at 0.812 but goes up to 1.00 quickly. Both knock monitors sit at 0.00 95% of the time but I have seen some negative numbers for a split second. I know I have seen -2.80 and one other negative number, but I can't recall right now.

When the car was first up and running the turbo spooled a little high, so I replaced the bpv spring and then it seemed to work just fine, I was hitting about 16 - 17 psi at max. and it drove seemingly fine and pulled hard. But I drove it like a grandma as I just got it running and wanted to make sure all issues were solved before pushing it hard at all. Only hard driving I did was 3rd gear pulls from 2k - 5.5k while data logging. Otherwise, I drove it like a normal car.

I know there are things I haven't tried yet (checking the oil pickup, smoke test (substituted with the compressed air test), got a dyno tune (no one within an hour and a half to do this) and I wanted to wait until the issues were figured out before spending the money on that.

I have run the Stage 1 91 octane and the Stage 2 91 octane (OTS) maps just to get by (I know... Not a custom tune). I have been doing everything I can think of to come up with a solution to these problems like watching YouTube videos (to get familiar with the issues), searching forums, even checking what Google Gemini and ChatGPT have to say about this (figured it was worth a try).

The turbo stopped boosting correctly after I removed the intercooler to check the starter bolts, I have checked every vacuum line and the hose (at least 3 times now) that connects from the intercooler to the intake manifold.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated, I know there are topics on these issues, and I feel like I've read every single one more than once. I am hoping for some assistance with this if possible.
Thanks
